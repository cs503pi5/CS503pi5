So we have a main py file and arduino file that communicate over serial port.

The camera (code in PI/py) that gives angle recorrection(

Odometer (py) info given by quadrature encoder (arduino) gives distance

Motors (arduino) move the robot

Ping (arduino) gives distance away

Motor and odometer first

Parts: PI, arduino, camera, odometer, ping, motor, IR
-pi and ard talk
-camera sees
-odometer result of IR, 
-ping distance
-motor motes

1) Find velocity vs pmw
2) using the equations: do pure transform and pure rotation
3) implement error correction
